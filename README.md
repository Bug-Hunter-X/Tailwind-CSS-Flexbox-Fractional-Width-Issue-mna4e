# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Fractional Width Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with Tailwind CSS flexbox when using fractional widths.  The issue arises when attempting to divide the available space equally among flex items using fractional widths like `w-1/2`. Instead of the expected equal distribution, the layout might collapse or not behave as anticipated.

## Bug Description

The problem manifests when using `w-1/2` (or similar fractions) within a flex container. The flex items may not occupy half the width each, resulting in unexpected rendering and layout issues. This could be due to various factors including incorrect parent container configurations, conflicting Tailwind directives, or unexpected interactions with other CSS styles.

## Solution

The solution will be provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
